This code runs the http://replaceawordinafamousquotewithduck.com/ micro-site.

For more info on it, check out this post: http://ye.gg/twitterad

grab.pl is a daemon and continually grabs new tweets from the #replaceawordinafamousquotewithduck hashtag and dumps them into grab.txt

out.pl normalizes, aggregates and sorts those tweets and then prints out the index html file.

That's all folks!
